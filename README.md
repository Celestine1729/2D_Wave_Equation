# 2D Wave Equation Solver

A modular, testable implementation of a 2D wave equation solver using finite difference methods.

## Features

- Modular design with separate components for boundary conditions, initial conditions, and solver
- Support for different boundary conditions (Dirichlet, Neumann)
- Configurable domain size, resolution, and wave speed
- Built-in visualization and animation capabilities
- Comprehensive test suite

## Installation

```bash
# Install from source
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wave-solver-2d.git
cd wave-solver
pip install -e .

# Or install directly from PyPI
pip install wave-solver-2d
```

## Usage
```
wave-solver -h

```
